# Handling Imbalanced Classification using SMOTE

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to handle imbalanced classification
problems using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

## Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn.

An artificial class imbalance is created to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Methodology
1. Artificially reduce samples from one class.
2. Apply SMOTE to balance the training dataset.
3. Train Logistic Regression model.
4. Evaluate performance using classification metrics.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Class Imbalance
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation
- Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results
The class distribution before and after SMOTE is displayed.
Classification performance metrics are printed for evaluation.
